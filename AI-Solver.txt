Heuristic 1: Misplaced Types
	counts the number of tiles that are out of place

Heuristic 2: Manhattan Distance
	sums the distances of each tile from its goal location
	as a measure of their absolute difference of their
	cooresponding coorinates

	Manhattan Distance of One Tile = | x1 - x2 | + | y1 - y2 |

Heuristic 3: Linear Conflict
	The Linear Conflict heuristic provides information on necessary 
	moves that are not counted in by the Manhattan Distance. Two 
	tiles tj and tk are said to be in a linear conflict if tj and 
	tk are in the same line, the goal positions of tj and tk are 
	both in that line, tj is to the right of tk and goal position 
	of tj is to the left of the goal position of tk.

Heuristic 4: Pattern Database (Probably the fastest method)
	Create a database of states and their distance to the goal.
